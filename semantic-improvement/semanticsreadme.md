This was an attempt at cleaning up the semantics of the html and css of the previous code presented. An overall attempt was made, but was completely foiled by a misunderstanding of github interface.

After a new repository was created, instead of trying to just copy and paste the files into the new repository, I manually saved them into it, but this changed the pathway. After changing the code to try and accomodate the new pathway, I realized that the images no longer were a part of the process.

At this point, it's too late to try and correct the mistakes, and I'll just have to learn from what I've done here today and push forward.
